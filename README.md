# Cambridge-Doc-Office
Proposal Website to present to the team at The Cambridge Doctor's Office

## Description

This should be a simple website that displays what the offices and the services it offers. The user should be able to book appontments with a specific doctor or just a general appointment and also should be able to cancel appointments. Users should be able view available slots for bookings for a specific time period. New users should be able to sign up and provide that specific information needed to book an appointment at the office.

There will also be an employee dashboard-like feature. With this feature the employee should be able to view the apppointments for the day and receive push notification for new appointments. The employee should also be able to book walk-in appointments for the day and also cancel or push up appointments.

Additonally users should be able to send in enquires to the office. The employee would use the dashboard-like feature to receive and handle such enquires.

#### **MAYBE**

A future version should entail a real-time chat feature. With the users can chat with employees real-time.

## Development

The website will be developed using **PHP** for the server-side. Later updates may see the website switching to a **Node JS** backend. **JavaScript** and/or **JQuery** **AJAX** will be used to perform some backend and client-to-server calls.

For the front-end views **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JQuery** will be used. Responsiveness and Mobile compatability will be done completely from scratch. Fonts and button icons will be imported from **Google Fonts** and **Google Material Icons**.
